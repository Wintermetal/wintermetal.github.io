                                <ul>
                                    <li>Abilities: She is basically a ship in human form. She can traverse on water quite quickly and she has a heavy broadside of 36 cannons (72 total).<br>Compared to a normal human, she can take a lot more hits (damage?) as she has the same durability as a warship, but she weighs about 10 881 times more than a normal human of her size. She needs special equipment to use her power to their full extent.</li><br>

                                    <li>Strengths: Very tough skin, She can traverse along water relatively fast. She can go for long periods of time without eating or drinking anything, but after that she has to refill her stock. As a side effect of her weight she is quite strong (She can momentarily lift up to ~1000 tonnes).</li><br>

                                    <li>Weaknesses: She weighs a lot. She uses a lot more energy compared to a normal person and has to eat accordingly. And everything that comes with a weight of 935.8 tonnes. She is quite slow on land. To use her cannons she has to consume gunpowder and cannonballs. Due to this she is quite volatile as she has a lot of gunpowder at all times.</li><br>

                                    <li>Counters against the ability: Land, ashore, ground. Her ability is useless on ground. Triumph also burns very easily.</li>

                                <p>She served in the Royal Navy from 1625 to 1668. She joined the Royal Navy during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty_Years%27_War" target="_b">Thirty years' war</a> and completed her maiden voyage during a conquest in Cadiz. After the war she sailed with the Royal Navy all across the world patrolling the British colonies. Not long after the Thirty years' war another war broke out with the Dutch known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Anglo-Dutch_War" target="_b">First Anglo-Dutch War (1652-1654)</a> She took part in multiple battles in the English channel and the North Sea. She didn't have long to celebrate the victory with her comrades as soon the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Spanish_War_(1654%E2%80%931660)" target="_b">Anglo-Spanish War (1654-1660)</a> broke out in 1654. She fought in the Battle of Santa Cruz and achieved a crushing victory against the Spanish. She took part in the blockade of Cadiz. After hostilities seized in Europe she was sent to the Caribbean to fight Spanish privateers and pirates who were attacking English ships. After retiring from the Royal Navy, she sailed the seas as a merchant and escorting other merchants and protected them from pirates and privateers.</p>
