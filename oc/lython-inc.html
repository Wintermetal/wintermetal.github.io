                            <p>Lython Incorporated was founded in 59 BBY by a man named Ledo Lython. She had an interest in spaceship design, but as the company was very small at the time they started off by producing droids under licence for other companies. The B-1 battledroid contracts for the CIS were extremely lucrative for the company and allowed massive growth. When the Clone Wars started Lython Incorporated the company had started to produce ships and had large orders of Venator-class ships from the Republic. The company split their droid production and ship production into separate subsidiaries called Lython Robotics and Lython Heavy Industries. As the Republic changed to the Empire the company changed their Venator production facilities to be able to produce Star Destroyers of different sizes. Along their large contracts they also produced their own designs for different ship types like freighters, fighters, bombers and capital ships. Lython Robotics has also received large contracts from the Empire, but they have also sold droids for the Rebel alliance. Lython Inc's own designs have rarely reaced market majority in anywhere but the Lipsec system, but they themselves often use their own ships and droids. As the New Republic rose to power after the fall of the Empire the company has stopped the production of Imperial ships and droids completely, but they still have the drawings for them. Lython Inc has received large contracts from the New Republic to build capital ships for the New Republic navy. When the Empire fell Lython Inc started testing waters in transport. Although they had always transported their own materials, but finally they started to offer these services to other companies and individuals under the name Lython Transport.The programming for all of Lython Robotics' droids has been done by Lython Softworks.</p>
