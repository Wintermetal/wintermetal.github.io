                            <p>Lython Incorporated was founded in 29 BBY by a man named Ledo Lython. The founder was originally born in Lipsec so he had the company registered to Lipsec, although all of the manufacturing plants of the company were located in Eriadu. He had an interest in spaceship design, but as the company was very small at the time they started off by producing droids under licence for other companies. The B-1 battledroid contracts for the CIS were extremely lucrative for the company and allowed large growth for the company. The company split their droid production and ship production into separate subsidiaries called Lython Robotics and Lython Heavy Industries. Lython Robotics has also received large contracts from the Empire, but they have also sold droids for the Rebel alliance. Although they had always transported their own materials, but finally in 10 BBY they started to offer these services to other companies and individuals under the name Lython Transport. The programming for all of Lython Robotics' droids has been done by Lython Softworks.</p>
