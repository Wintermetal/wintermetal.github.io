                            <p>Shortly after she was born she was taken by some doctors for a genetic experimentation. They gave her 2 more arms compared to normal human. The experimentation was a success and the new arms adapted into her body perfectly. The only complication from the experiment was that her right eye was rather badly scarred and the eye went blind. After her new arms were attached the scientists raised her like a normal human and to their and her delight the arms acted like her original arms and grew normally. As she has had four arms as long as she can remember she has perfectly adapted to use them as if she was born with them. As she was old enough to start school she was sent to a normal school, but as she got bullied for her arms she was moved to home schooling. When she turned 18 she finally finished her studies and was hired as a waitress in a high-end restaurant. After a few years of working as a waitress she was hired at an exotic bar as a waiterss, but as it was an exotic bar she had to wear a bunny suit. While she worked at the bar she auditioned for a movie and proved that she was good at acting, but due to having more arms she wasn't suitable for the role she auditioned for. The director who interviewed her got an idea for a different movie and she was cast as the main lead of the movie. She moved to the Steam Empire for the movie.</p>
