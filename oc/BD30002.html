                            <p>Biala was one of the first BD-3000s manufactured and she was purchased by senator. The senator was pleased by her and fitted her to work as his personal bodyguard and translator so he had a good excuse to have her with him anywhere he went. Due to how her owner liked her he never even thought about wiping her memory. Shortly before the start of the Clone Wars while the senator was travelling with Biala aboard his Consular-class cruiser some bounty hunters attacked the ship with ion weapons and managed to disable the ship and all droids aboard. They proceeded to clear all living organisms on the ship. When the effect of the ion weapons wore off and Biala "woke up" there was nobody aboard the ship and it was just drifting aimlessly in space. As she no longer had a master to serve she took up bounty hunting using the ship of her former master. At first she wore a cloak and other clothing to hide the fact that she was a droid, but later she acquired some armour. Between the Clonewars and the Galactic civil war she just continued to collect bounties.</p>
