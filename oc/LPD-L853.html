                                        <li>L85 is a good pilot and navigator as she is a pilot droid.</li>
                                        <li>L85 is good at multitasking as her central processing unit (CPU) has 8 cores so she has enough processing power to do multiple things at the same time.</li>
                                        <li>L85 is hard to sneak up on as she has sensors that she uses to "see" all around her even if her main visual sensor is pointing in other direction.</li>
                                        <li>L85 is fluent in over six million forms of communication as she "acquired" the language database from a protocol droid.</li>

                                        <li>L85's aim isn't very good as she was not designed to be a combat droid so she has to use the sights like an organic.</li>
                                        <li>It is difficult for L85 to detect lies due to her being a droid.</li>
                                        <li>L85 is very vulnerable to water and other liquids.</li>
                                        <li>L85 can be easily be enslaved with a restraining bolt.</li>
                                        <li>L85 is often treated like a second class citizen due to her being a droid</li>

                            <p>An undetermined amount of time before the events of the Solo-movie (10 BBY) some droid designers from Lython Robotics were tasked with coming up a domestic pilot droid that could replace human pilots on passenger and freight lines. They decided to go look for inspiration in other places in the galaxy. The designers encountered a droid that differed from all the others as it acted as if it was human so they approached the droid and its owner and asked if they could reverse engineer the droid in order to manufacture more droids just like the one. They offered to pay quite a large sum of credits to them and to the surprise of the droid the designers treated the droid as if it was an organic. After they got their measurements and everything they needed they presented their findings to their higher ups who were pleased with the plans and started to set up production lines. The first model was made in 10 BBY and was designated as LPD-L85. As per the original the droids were given a feminine programming and they had navigational charts loaded to aid them in their job. LPD-L85 was assigned to fly a Kannus-class freighter, carrying materials to and from Lython.<br><br>
                            Once when she was waiting to lift off on Tatooine two thugs tried to steal the ship and threw her in some corner of the ship. This made her realise that not all organics were as good as the ones she had interacted thus far. While the two thugs were trying to figure out how to fly the ship and all of their attention was focused on the flight instruments. After all what could a dumb pilot droid do to them? She came up behind the thugs as they sat next to each other and she placed her hands on opposite sides of their heads and quickly pressed her hands together, smashing everything inbetween. As she was clearing the headless bodies out of the cockpit she finally realised that she could start to do some smuggling on her own instead of working for a freight company.
                            <br><br>
                            She was very successful at smuggling since nobody suspected that a pilot droid would be carrying contraband so her ship was never inspected very thoroughly which made her a very good smuggler. She never repainted herself or her ship as that would keep her facade perfect. She did get herself a blaster pistol to protect herself from thugs who might want to steal her ship and/or cargo. She attached a leather holster for her blaster on her hip so the pistol wouldn't fall out from the holster when she sat down on the flight seat.
                            <br><br>
                            Over the years she got better at smuggling and once she found the head of a dismembered protocol droid once she was in Bespin so she copied the language data that the protocol droid had.</p>
