Lython Inc. produces a lot of products including, but not limited to: ships, droids, body armour and software. The company also offers transport services. The main production facility of the company is a planetary ring around the planet of Lipsec. Similar to Kuat drive yard's planetary ring.

                            <h3>History</h3>  <!-- The character's backstory -->
                            <p>Lython Incorporated was founded in 289 BBY by a man named Ledo Lython. He had an interest in spaceship design, but as the company was very small at the time they started off by producing droids under licence for other companies. Later the company expanded the building ships, but as they didn't really have ship designers they had to mainly rely on building ships under licence for other companies. The B-1 battledroid contracts for the CIS were extremely lucrative for the company and allowed large growth. Shortly before the Clone wars the company got contracts from the Kaminoans to manufacture Venator-class star destroyers and other ships for the Republic. The company split their droid production and ship production into separate subsidiaries called Lython Robotics and Lython Heavy Industries. Lython Robotics has received large contracts from the Empire, but they have also sold droids for the Rebel alliance secretly. Although they had always transported their own materials, but finally in 10 BBY they started to offer these services to other companies and individuals under the name Lython Transport. The programming for all of Lython Robotics' droids has been done by Lython Softworks. After the Galactic civil war ended and the Empire collapsed the company recieved orders for capitalships from the New Republic. The ISDs that they had been building at the time of the Empire's collapsed were broken up for their materials to build new ships for the New Republic. During the rule of the Empire LHI managed to grow due to the empire's large orders of ships and droids. During this time Lython Inc started a new subsidiary called Lython Armoury to produce body armour for the Empire. When the First Order was on the rise they ordered equipment from Lython Inc as they were located in the outer rim and outside the main influence sphere of the New Republic.</p>
