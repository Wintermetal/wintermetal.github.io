                            <h3>Agent of Perseus</h3>
                            <p>Bell was born in Volgograd in 1937. In 1939 when the Second World War started both of her brothers and her father were conscripted to the army and she stayed at home with her mother. In the January of 1943 her family received a telegram that both of her brothers had been killed in action. In 1945 her father came back from the war unscathed as he had been working as a radioman at the headquarters. She as grew up she wanted to become a secret operative and she applied to work for the KGB. In 1968 she was offered a job by Perseus and she decided to take the offer.<br>
                                
                            <br>During the 1980s, Bell was present during a meeting with Arash Kadivar, Anton Volkov, Vladimir Rudnik and Robert Aldrich where Perseus exposed his fears about the United States' power slowly consuming the Soviet Union and the Soviet leaders doing nothing about it. He revealed his plan to steal an American nuclear bomb which could unlock the Greenlight nuclear arsenals based throughout Europe. From there, Perseus planned to detonate all the bombs so he could alter the balance of power in the Cold War in the Soviet Union's favor and create a Greater Russia.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Trabzon Airfield incident</h3>
                            <p>On January 13, 1981, Bell accompanied Kadivar to the Trabzon airfield in Turkey. Kadivar revealed to her that they were supposed to transport weapons in a plane to Duga before shipping them to Volkov. Kadivar, however, jealous of Bell's status in Perseus' ring, had other plans and shot Bell inside the car leaving her for dead. After CIA operatives Alex Mason, Frank Woods, and Russell Adler prevented Kadivar from leaving the country, they swept the tarmac for survivors and found Bell still alive with a dossier related to Perseus.</p>

                            <h3>MKUltra</h3>
                            <p>After Bell recovered from her injuries, the CIA tried traditional interrogation for days, to no avail. It was then decided to brainwash them through the CIA's MKUltra Program into trying to give up Perseus' location. During several weeks, through painful psychological torture, neuroactive drugs and hypnosis, the CIA, with the help of MI6 agent, Helen Park, used Adler's experience in Vietnam to create a bond with Bell, implanting fake memories of the war and backgrounds into their mind and altering their personality and identity to make them believe they knew Adler for years. Once the training was completed, Adler gave them their nickname "Bell". Adler also used the phrase "We've got a job to do" (as well as "We had a job to do" or "We have a job to do") whenever he wanted Bell to remember her fake memories and being kept in check. Jason Hudson, however, wasn't so keen on having Bell as a member of Adler's team to hunt Perseus.<br>
                            
                            <br>Now part of Adler's team, Bell arrived in the CIA Safehouse E9 in West Berlin on February 23rd. The team was composed of Adler, Bell, Park as well as Lawrence Sims and Eleazar "Lazar" Azoulay. The team made Bell relive their implanted memories to decrypt the dossier found in Trabzon, which gave several names including Anton Volkov. Adler and Park would continue injecting Bell drugs without her knowledge during the following weeks to ensure the brainwash was still effective.<br>
                                
                            <br>After Bell had helped Adler's team with tracking down Perseus the CIA made sure she still believed her implanted memories. She moved close to Gemora after she retired in 1984 at the age of 47.</p>
