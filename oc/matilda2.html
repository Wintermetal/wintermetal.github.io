                            <p>Usually Matilda has the mannerisms of an elegant lady and is kind and polite to everyone. She is hard to anger, but when she gets angry she becomes very angry and brutal. When angry she doesn't seem to value human life. In public she always acts elegantly and she usually arrives with her Rolls-Royce if she can.</p>

                                <li>Weaknesses: When angry she is hard to calm down before her rampage is over, bad in hand to hand combat against anyone with training</li>

                            <p>Matilda was born on 29th of February in 1996. She started her education at Canary Wharf College and continued in George Green's School. She lived her entire childhood in Deptford as her father owned the Deptford dockyard. After she was finished with school she got some work at the dockyard where she suffered an accident in which she lost the lower portion of her left leg. She chose a wooden peg leg instead of a proper prosthetic as she preferred the look and the roughness of wood. After the accident her father decided that she should go get some more education so she would be better equipped to be the Managing Director of the company when he has to retire. She decided to honour her father's choice and applied to a school in the US.</p>
