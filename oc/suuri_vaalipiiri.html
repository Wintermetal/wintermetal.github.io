                                    <h4>Abilities</h4>
                                    <p>She is basically a battleship in human form. She can traverse on water quite quickly and she is very heavily armed:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>8x 50.8 cm Main guns</li>
                                        <li>12x 15 cm Secondary guns</li>
                                        <li>16x 10.5 cm Secondary guns</li>
                                        <li>28x 3.7 cm Anti-Air guns</li>
                                        <li>40x 2 cm Anti-Air guns</li>
                                        <li>6x 53.3 cm Torpedoes</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <br><p>Compared to a normal human, she can take a lot more hits (damage?) as she has the same durability as a warship, but she weighs about 13 100 000 times more than a normal human of her size. She needs special equipment to use her power to their full extent. She has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_catapult" target="_b">catapult</a> to launch <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerial_reconnaissance" target="_b">reconnaissance</a> planes. She can hold up to 9 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arado_Ar_196" target="_b">Arado Ar 196</a>-planes in reserve. When the planes ar launched they often fly in a large circle above Großer Kurfürst.</p><br>

                                    <h4>Strengths</h4>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Very tough skin, She can traverse on water at 29.8 knots (55.2 km/h), but accelerates to that top speed slowly.</li>
                                        <li>She can go for long periods of time without eating or drinking anything, but after that she has to refill her stock.</li>
                                        <li>As a side effect of her weight she is quite strong (She can momentarily lift up to ~131 000 tonnes).</li>
                                        <li>Großer Kurfürst can recover (with the help of a dockyard) from almost any injury.</li>
                                        <li>She is very good against large predictably moving targets (like ships) and large mainly stationary groups of small soft targets.</li>
                                        <li>Her main 50.8cm guns have a maximum range of 20.61 km @820m/s. At maximum range the shells spend ~30 seconds in flight.</li>
                                        <li>Her 15 cm guns have a maximum range of 7.7 km and the 10.5 cm guns have a range of 6 km.</li>
                                        <li>Her 3.7 cm Anti-Air gun have a maximum range of 4 km and 2 cm guns have a maximum range of 2 km</li>
                                        <li>Her 53.3 cm torpedoes have a maximum range of 6 km and arm only after they have travelled 100 meters.</li>
                                        <li>She has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_catapult" target="_b">catapult</a> to launch <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerial_reconnaissance" target="_b">reconnaissance</a> planes. She can hold up to 9 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arado_Ar_196" target="_b">Arado Ar 196</a>-planes in reserve.</li>
                                        <li>The reconnaissance planes allow GK to use her guns more effectively as they spot targets for her and she can focus on firing.</li>
                                        <li>With the aid of the planes she can hit targets more accurately at her maximum range as they can help range the shot more accurately.</li>
                                    </ul><br>

                                    <h4>Weaknesses</h4>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>She weighs a lot. Due to her weight she is extremely slow and moves at about half as fast as a normal human.</li>
                                        <li>She uses a lot more energy compared to a normal person and has to eat accordingly.</li>
                                        <li>She needs diesel to move, and if she runs out of diesel she can't move at all.</li>
                                        <li>She is half as fast as a normal human of her size, it takes her 40 seconds to turn her head 180° (4,5°/s).</li>
                                        <li>She requires a lot of ammunition for her armament due to this she is quite volatile at all times.</li>
                                        <li>Großer Kurfürst can only recover from small injuries by herself, with anything major she has to go to a dockyard for "repairs" these repairs may even take months depending on the severity.</li>
                                        <li>Her main 50.8cm guns are extremely inaccurate and she has troubles hitting any small or unpredictably moving targets. Her main guns also take a long time to reload.</li>
                                        <li>She has to calculate the shell trajectory, the speed of the enemy and where the shell will land before firing.</li>
                                        <li>Großer Kurfürst's reconnaissance planes have very limited fuel so the can stay up in the air for about 2 minutes. When the planes have to land they can go and land on shore (Fields, beaches and roads) or on the water next to her so she can recover the planes and refuel  them so they can be used again during the same battle.</li>
                                        <li>Her planes have no armament so they can't attack anything and can be shot down easily as they aren't very maneuverable planes.</li>
                                        <li>It takes Großer Kurfürst around 5-10 minutes to get ready to launch a plane again after she has launched one.</li>
                                    </ul><br>

                                    <h4>Counters against the ability</h4>
                                    <ul>

                                        <li>Her ability is useless on ground</li>
                                        <li>She needs her equipment to use her abilities.</li>
                                        <li>She cannot hit precisely targets that are small and move unpredictably</li>
                                        <li>Disrupting the communication between GK and her planes so they can't report anything to her and she won't gain any advantage from having the plane in the air.</li>
                                    </ul>

                                <p>As shipgirls don't age she looked like an adult when she was born and started her training and education at a young age. Her constuction was started in 1944, but it was halted soon after it begin, this meant that her conciousness was trapped in some sort of an abyss for as long as she was under construction. She was briefly brought to life during construction to be taught the nazi ideals and propaganda before she was put back under until her completion. During her time in the abyss all she had was what she was taught before she was trapped.

                                During the 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐇𝐮𝐦𝐚𝐧 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐌𝐞𝐭𝐚-𝐇𝐮𝐦𝐚𝐧 𝐖𝐚𝐫 some scientist from the Meta-human's side were looking for something to aid them in the fight and they found a secret Nazi base in Germany that hadn't been found after 1944. In the secret base they found Großer Kurfürst laying unfinished labeled as H-44. The scientists also found her sisters H-39, H-40, H-41, H-42 and H-43, but they didn't have resources to complete all of them. The scientists completed H-44 and and released her conciousness from the abyss. They left her sisters in the base. The scientists convinced her that they were members of the NSDAP to get her to help them. She fought in the conflict for the Meta-humans thinking she was fighting the Second World War against the allies. After the conflict she found out they had lied to her and she destoyed the base she had operated from in anger and left. She chose the name Großer Kurfürst herself when she was revived as she didn't want to be called H-44.
