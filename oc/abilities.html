                            <h3>Vesihiisi</h3>
                            <p>shipgirl (1930s submarine)</p>
                            <ul>
                                <h4>Abilities</h4>
                                <p>Vesihiisi is a shipgirl (a submarine) so she has the same abilities as a normal (real life) submarine. Her armament includes: 4x torpedo tubes (2 aft, 2 stern), 1x 75mm Bofors cannon (76/48 28LT), 1x 20mm ItK/39M Madsen, 1x 7.62mm ItKK/31 VKT, 20x seamines and a depth charge rack with 4 depth charges. She can dive as deep as 75 m (246 ft). She uses T/40 <!--(IT) 53.3 cm (21") W 250/533.4 x 6.72--> torpedoes which have a maximum range of 8km (@38kn) / 4km (@49kn) with a 270kg (595lb) charge. Her torpedoes arm only after they have travelled 150 meters for the safety of Vesihiisi. Her 75mm Bofors (75x604mmR) has a maximum range of 11km with a muzzle velocity of 850m/s. Her 20mm Madsen Anti-Aircraft cannon (20x120mm) has a maximum range of 900 meters with a muzzle velocity of 900m/s and a rate of fire of 250 rpm. Her 20mm AA-gun uses flak shells that explode one second after firing. She has a Twin 7,62mm machine gun (7,62x54mmR) with a cyclic fire-rate of 2x 900 rpm with a muzzle velocity of 800-810m/s.</p><br>

                                <h4>Strengths</h4>
                                <p>Very tough skin, She can traverse along water relatively fast (23,3 km/h on surface, 15.7 km/h submerged) and can stay underwater for 20 hours before she has to resurface. Can go for 150 hours without eating or drinking anything. As a side effect of her weight she is quite strong (She can momentarily lift up to ~500 tonnes of weight).</p><br>

                                <h4>Weaknesses</h4>
                                <p>She weighs a lot. She uses a lot more energy compared to a normal person and has to eat accordingly. After not eating or drinking for 150 hours she has to eat ~30 tonnes of food. She needs diesel to move and she has a capacity of 20 liters. If she runs out of diesel she can't move at all. After diving she has a state of higher energy consumption as she "recharges". Recharge time is dependant on the time she was underwater. She emits a quiet rumbling noise (like a quiet diesel engine) at all times except when she sleeps and when she dives. The more she stresses herself physcally, the louder and faster the noise. And everything that comes with a weight of ~500 tonnes. Vesihiisi can only recover from small injuries by herself, with anything major she has to go to a dockyard for "repairs" these repairs may even take months depending on the severity. She needs ammunition for her weapons and as they are quite old it is hard to find anyone who still manufactures them.</p><br>

                                <h4>Abilities</h4>
                                <p>She is basically a ship in human form. She can traverse on water quite quickly and she has a heavy broadside of 36 cannons (72 total).<br>Compared to a normal human, she can take a lot more hits (damage?) as she has the same durability as a warship, but she weighs about 10 881 times more than a normal human of her size. She needs special equipment to use her power to their full extent.</p><br>

                                <h4>Strengths</h4>
                                <p>Very tough skin, She can traverse along water relatively fast. She can go for long periods of time without eating or drinking anything, but after that she has to refill her stock. As a side effect of her weight she is quite strong (She can momentarily lift up to ~1000 tonnes). Triumph can recover (with the help of a dockyard) from almost any injury.</p><br>

                                <h4>Weaknesses</h4>
                                <p>She weighs a lot. She uses a lot more energy compared to a normal person and has to eat accordingly. And everything that comes with a weight of 935.8 tonnes. She is quite slow on land. To use her cannons she has to consume gunpowder and cannonballs. Due to this she is quite volatile as she has a lot of gunpowder at all times. Triumph needs wind to be able to move around on water as she uses sails to move. Triumph can only recover from small injuries by herself, with anything major she has to go to a dockyard for "repairs".</p><br>

                                <li>8x 50.8 cm Main guns</li>

                            <br><p>Compared to a normal human, she can take a lot more hits (damage?) as she has the same durability as a warship, but she weighs about 13 100 000 times more than a normal human of her size. She needs special equipment to use her power to their full extent. She has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_catapult" target="_b">catapult</a> to launch <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerial_reconnaissance" target="_b">reconnaissance</a> planes. She can hold up to 9 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arado_Ar_196" target="_b">Arado Ar 196</a>-planes in reserve. When the planes ar launched they often fly in a large circle above Großer Kurfürst.</p><br>

                            <h4>Strengths</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Very tough skin, She can traverse on water at 29.8 knots (55.2 km/h), but accelerates to that top speed slowly.</li>
                                <li>She can go for long periods of time without eating or drinking anything, but after that she has to refill her stock.</li>
                                <li>As a side effect of her weight she is quite strong (She can momentarily lift up to ~131 000 tonnes).</li>
                                <li>Großer Kurfürst can recover (with the help of a dockyard) from almost any injury.</li>
                                <li>She is very good against large predictably moving targets (like ships) and large mainly stationary groups of small soft targets.</li>
                                <li>Her main 50.8cm guns have a maximum range of 20.61 km @820m/s. At maximum range the shells spend ~30 seconds in flight.</li>
                                <li>Her 15 cm guns have a maximum range of 7.7 km and the 10.5 cm guns have a range of 6 km.</li>
                                <li>Her 3.7 cm Anti-Air gun have a maximum range of 4 km and 2 cm guns have a maximum range of 2 km</li>
                                <li>Her 53.3 cm torpedoes have a maximum range of 6 km and arm only after they have travelled 100 meters.</li>
                                <li>She has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_catapult" target="_b">catapult</a> to launch <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerial_reconnaissance" target="_b">reconnaissance</a> planes. She can hold up to 9 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arado_Ar_196" target="_b">Arado Ar 196</a>-planes in reserve.</li>
                                <li>The reconnaissance planes allow GK to use her guns more effectively as they spot targets for her and she can focus on firing.</li>
                                <li>With the aid of the planes she can hit targets more accurately at her maximum range as they can help range the shot more accurately.</li>
                            </ul><br>

                            <h4>Weaknesses</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>She weighs a lot. Due to her weight she is extremely slow and moves at about half as fast as a normal human.</li>
                                <li>She uses a lot more energy compared to a normal person and has to eat accordingly.</li>
                                <li>She needs diesel to move, and if she runs out of diesel she can't move at all.</li>
                                <li>She is half as fast as a normal human of her size, it takes her 40 seconds to turn her head 180° (4,5°/s).</li>
                                <li>She requires a lot of ammunition for her armament due to this she is quite volatile at all times.</li>
                                <li>Großer Kurfürst can only recover from small injuries by herself, with anything major she has to go to a dockyard for "repairs" these repairs may even take months depending on the severity.</li>
                                <li>Her main 50.8cm guns are extremely inaccurate and she has troubles hitting any small or unpredictably moving targets. Her main guns also take a long time to reload.</li>
                                <li>She has to calculate the shell trajectory, the speed of the enemy and where the shell will land before firing.</li>
                                <li>Großer Kurfürst's reconnaissance planes have very limited fuel so the can stay up in the air for about 2 minutes. When the planes have to land they can go and land on shore (Fields, beaches and roads) or on the water next to her so she can recover the planes and refuel  them so they can be used again during the same battle.</li>
                                <li>Her planes have no armament so they can't attack anything and can be shot down easily as they aren't very maneuverable planes.</li>
                                <li>It takes Großer Kurfürst around 5-10 minutes to get ready to launch a plane again after she has launched one.</li>
                            </ul><br>

She has a <a href="https://titanfall.fandom.com/wiki/XO16A2_Chaingun" target="_b">20mm chaingun</a> and rocket pods with either homing or non-homing rockets. She can also siphon protective shields from other titans. As LLT-L4299 is an AI she can be transferred to other machines that have sufficient processing power. She can electrify her own exterior to force anyone who is climbing on her to let go and fall off. LLT-L4299 has an energy shield that protects her from any hull damage while it is active. Whenever she recharges herself, her shield is also recharged. If she is running low on power the shield is disabled. She can use her thrusters to quickly dodge an attack, but due to her weight they have to recharge for a while.</li>
    
                                <li>Strengths: Armour able to withstand smallarms fire. She has a lot of firepower thanks to her fully automatic 20mm chaingun. She can fire 6 rockets with a single rocket salvo. She can kill her enemies just by stepping onto them.</li>
    
                                <li>Weaknesses: She is very large and heavy which makes it difficult to get inside buildings and other small places. She has her main battery situated at the top of her chassis and it can be removed if someone is able to climb ontop of her. She cannot sneak and her footsteps can be easily heard and felt.</li>
    
                                <li>Cooldown or con of using the ability: She needs to reload her 20mm gun as it only has a 40 round chain. After firing her rocket salvo it has to reload for a while before she can use it. If she takes the rocket pod out before it is reloaded, it interrupts the reload process. She can electrify her exterior for only a short time and it has a long reload .</li>
                                
                                <li>Counters against the ability: Anti-Tank weapons are effective against her as her armour is very similar to that of a tank's.</li>

LRAC-L517 has great firepower with his 30 mm Minigun called the Predator cannon. He can deploy a shield around the Predator cannon to protect himself. He can charge a more powerful shot that has the same effect as a High-Explosive shell. As LRAC-L517 is an AI he can be transferred to other machines that have sufficient processing power. He can electrify his own exterior to force anyone who is climbing on him to let go and fall off. LRAC-L517 has an energy shield that protects him from any hull damage while it is active. Whenever he recharges himself, his shield is also recharged. If he is running low on power the shield is disabled.

                                <li>Cooldown or con of using the ability: His minigun has only 100 rounds and he needs to reload the gun when he runs out of shells. His shield can only take a limited amount of hits until it turns off and has to recharge for some time. If the shield isn't shot out it'll turn off on its own after a while. His charged shot uses a lot of energy so he has to wait for a while before he can use it again.</li>
    
                                <li>Counters against the ability: Anti-Tank weapons are effective against him as his armour is very similar to that of a modern tank. Anti-titan weapons would be even more effective, but they are extremely rare on Earth</li>

                                Examples of her powers include: gaining night-vision after a few seconds in the dark; functional gills after being submerged in water; fire-proof skin after being exposed to flame; converting her body into pure energy; no longer requiring oxygen after being sucked into space; morphing into a sponge when shot at with a weapon designed to destroy the subject's nervous system. Her power may concern itself with more efficient methods of survival than Kaarina herself might choose.
                                            
                                Her power can also work when dealing with non-immediately-life-threatening situations, such as rendering it impossible for Kaarina to get drunk by allowing her body to process alcohol faster than humans would normally.</li>
