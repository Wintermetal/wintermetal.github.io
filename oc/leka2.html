Her left eye has mutated and can only see in X-ray, this is noticable if you look at the eye closely. Only her left eye can see X-ray.</li>

                            <p>Leka was born in Utsjoki in Northern Finland in 1974. When she was inspected by the doctors they noticed that her left eye wasn't normal, but they didn't think much of it and marked her as healthy. When she was 7-years old and went to school for the first time she realised that the others couldn't see through things like she could. When she entered vocational school she started dating one of her classmates, but it ended soon after they had graduated when she found him cheating on her. She decided to move to the US as she had heard that things were better there for people with abnormalities. She visited Russia and found out an army depot that had IS-3 tanks in storage waiting to be scrapped or taken somewhere else. She stole one and smuggled it back into the US with her. She started to develop systems that would allow her to operate the entire tank just by herself, without losing any combat capacity. She swapped the engine for a more powerful and modern one to improve the mobility of the old tank.</p>
