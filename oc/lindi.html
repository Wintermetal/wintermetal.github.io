                            <p>She was the only child of her family and when she was 2 years old she was taken by the jedi order for training. She was an extensive user of form 2. She completed her training and she was a Jedi Knight when Order 66 was initiated. Luckily for her she was on a solo mission scouting some Separatist strongholds she managed to survive the order. She decided to go into hiding on her home planet of Lython, although she was not aware that it was her home planet. On the planet she decided to apply for a job at the planet's shipyard as she thought she could blend in there easily. She was taken in to a special interview by the Managing Director of the company who had been following her development with the jedi as the MD was her mother. She was welcomed to her real family with open arms. Only 3 years later she had been integrated back into the family and when her mother retired she appointed Lindi as the MD of Lython Incorporated. During the decades after the Order she has suppressed her connection to the force so she could hide from the Empire as best as she could, although it would be highly unlikely that the MD of a large company like Lython Inc. would be suspected of being a Jedi.</p>
