                            <h3>Geography:</h3>
                            <p>Lython’s geography is easy to describe; you can see it in terms of a division between a broad south-eastern core radiating out roughly from Leptford, which is generally low-lying, fertile and easily traversable land, and the north and west, lumpier and bonier with uplands, hills and mountains dominating, intersected with strong rivers and characterfully-named valleys. All this is accentuated by major rivers like the Levern and Lentdale draining in alternate directions from the massy spine of the island and pointing out to sea.
<br><br>
                            That binary geographical division is very simple, of course. Within those two zones, there are a multiplicity of exceptions, contradictions and islands of unusualness; it wouldn’t be England if there weren’t. We might say the south-east is low-lying, but that varies between rolling low hills, gentle undulations and steppe-like flatness. Even within the flatness, there’s variety. No-one would confuse the flatness of Lorcestershire, its tall poplars spearing the sky, with the horizon-filled bleakness of parts of the Lestershire fens or the pretty wetlands of the Norfolk Broads. Something else always overlaps and brings a different level of interest. The valleys in the north have large forests as the soil is rich, but unsuitable for growing crops.</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li><h4>Leptford</h4></li>
                                <p>The capital and the largest city in the country. It is located near the sea shore, along the Lipitor-river, which is the largest river in the country.</p>
                                <li><h4>Lichmouth</h4></li>
                                <p>A large city on the shore and the home of the Queen's fleet.</p>
                                <li><h4>Leedsham</h4></li>
                                <p>A large inland mining town with many blacksmiths and metal workshops.</p>
                                <li><h4>Lenham</h4></li>
                                <p>A small inland lumber village located in the Leighsdale valley.</p>
                                <li><h4>Leaufort</h4></li>
                                <p>A fortress on the sea shore near Leptford, protecting the city from any attacks coming from the sea.</p>
                            </ul>

                            <h3>Rural life:</h3>
                            <p>Most people who live in the rural areas to the south-east of the country are farmers who live near small villages. The farmers are in most cases self-sufficient. To the north-west there isn't much fertile land for farms so a lot of people who live in the rural areas are lamb farmers. In the forested areas people live in small lumber towns and cut down trees for living.</p>
                            <hr>
                            <h3>Urban life:</h3>
                            <p>The urban life of the biggest cities differ from each other greatly. Leptford is the biggest and thus has the most generalized business, but all the other cities are heavily focused in one type of business. Lichmouth has a large number of sailors living in the city as it works as the home port for the Queen's fleet and many merchant fleets. Leedsham is a mining town so there is a lot of metallurgy and since the city is inland there is need for wagon repair and stables. Lenham is the largest of the lumber towns, but it is still small compared to some other towns, however it is notable as an inventor lives there an he is adamant in finding a way to make humans fly.</p>
