                            <p>Mokarran was born in 2002 somewhere in the Atlantic ocean, but it isn't certain where it was. She grew up without really knowing her mother and she never saw her father. As she grew up she learned to become a great hunter and started to really like hunting stingrays. The older she got the more she ventured out to deeper waters, but she rarely went very deep as she enjoyed the warm water of the shallows. While she was growing she travelled a lot along the west coast of Africa, Europe and the mediterranean. One time she was spotted by some fishermen when she was hunting stingrays in the shallow waters and they managed to pull her out of the water with their nets. This was her first encounter with humans and it did not leave a good impression. Surprisingly she could breath when out of the water as she had the upper body of a human female. The fishermen managed to capture her by entangling her in their net and they brought her to the shore and tried to sell her. A marine biologist who was looking for some rare fish caught by fishermen and he spotted Mokarran and bought her to save her from others who might harm her. He took her to his laboratory and he studied her, but he also treated her with respect and taught her English. Once he had all the information he needed and he thought he couldn't teach her anything more he decided to send her to a school for people who aren't normal.She promised that if he needed to study her more he could as she really liked it. Due to her experience she has a heavy dislike of fishermen and their boats. She likes to be playful with normal boats and row boats.</p>
