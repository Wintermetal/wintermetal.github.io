                            <p>Nessie is extremely happy and playful most of the time. She is friendly towards humans as she hasn't had any bad experiences with humans before. She sometimes plays pranks on fishermen on smaller boats. She has a shark fin on her back and sometimes she likes to scare people by swimming so close to the surface that people see it. She would rather flee than fight, but will fight if she has to.</p>

                            <h3>Background</h3>  <!-- The character's backstory -->
                            <p>She was born to a human mother somewhere along the shore of Itrais, but her biological mother threw her in the sea when she was only a new born because of how she was half shark half human. Her shark insticts took over and she learned to fend for herself, but she rarely ventured out to too deep water. Once when she was hunting for food she noticed a hook in the water with a worm on it. A small fish ate the worm and suddenly it was pulled out of the water. She hadn't seen something like it before so she raised her head above the surface in curiosity. She saw an old man who was sitting in a boat, fishing. The man got scared of her at first, but as she didn't do anything he relaxed. He gave her a fish and she swam away, but she started to go to the spot every day and would meet the man there. She got to know the man who taught her to speak and understand English. As they became good friends the man get her the name Nessie. One day the man told her that he had to move to an island called Ebraia and he said that she could follow him or stay. She decided to follow him, although she didn't tell that to him. When he sailed from Itrais to Ebraia she swam under the ship for most of the journey and she was delighted as upon arrival on the shores of Ebraia she saw that the sealife near Ebraia was plentyful. She decided she would settle around Ebraia and during her years living there she has circled the island many times. After the move to Ebraia she saw the fisherman less, but she was still happy there. One day when she met him, he was standing on a beach with something hidden behind him. It was going to be the last time he could come to the sea as he was getting old so he had made her a wheelchair so she could go on land. She visited his house multiple times, until he passed away due to old age. She was sad for a long time, but regained her positive outlook on life.</p>
