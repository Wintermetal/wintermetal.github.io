                            <h3>Background</h3>  <!-- The character's backstory -->
                            <p>Kaarina was born and grew up in Kokkola. She found out about her ability at the age of 5 when she triggered it accidentally and she started crying because she couldn't see anything when she became invisible. Later when she did it again by accident she wasn't as scared and she realised that her parents were in the same room, but couldn't see her. She started practicing her ability and at the age of 7 she had learned to control it, but she never told anyone about the ability. She pranked her parents and siblings with her ability as she would often suggest to play hide and seek. She won their hide and seek everytime she had to hide as usually she just turned invisible. When she was at school she was always the tallest in her class and some wanted to bully her for it, but the bullies were intimidated by how much taller she was compared to them so they changed their mind. Due to this she became quite popular with people who would get bullied, but when they were with her the bullies didn't get close to them as they were intimidated by Kaarina's height. She wanted to become a professional rally driver, but she knew that most likely it wouldn't happen so she decided to train to become a professional software engineer so she could work anywhere she had WiFi. When she finished her studies she decided to treat herself and bought a red Saab 96 her friend had modified and was looking to sell. The Saab she had bought was a replica of a Saab 96 used in a TV-show called Kummeli. She decided to video all her drives using a dashcam and uploaded them online so she can easily review her drives. Her videos gained popularity and she decided to start to make the videos designed for an audience of watchers instead of just for herself. She decided to move to the US as she heard that they have great dirt roads to drive on.</p>
